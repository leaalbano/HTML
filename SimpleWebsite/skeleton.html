<h2>About Me:</h2>
I'm a 3rd year CS student at CSUF. I'm from Union City, CA which is located in the East Bay Area. So far, I think living in Southern California is more fun. I enjoy petting my cats, hiking, and discovering new food places. I cook veggie-based meals at home in order to cut down my meat intake, but when I go out I am open to eating meat. My favorite food is Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) and the best place I've tried was Pho Ha Noi in San Jose, CA. My least favorite food would have to be Poke Bowls (unpopular opinion I know).
<h2>Things I don't understand:</h2>
- Why some people enjoy watching The Bachelor or Love Island.<br>
- Why alcholism is normalized in college.<br>
- How some people wake up at 5am for fun. <br>
- Why some people think English Bulldogs are cute.<br>

<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
- My dream job is to become a mukbanger.<br>
- I've started writing Yelp reviews in order to become an Elite Yelper. <br>
- I got one of my cats from Craigslist for $60. <br>
- I want to become a UX Designer after college. <br>
- I'm already a crazy cat lady at the age of 20.
